# Pokeapi

This project is an example project for @ngrx and primeng usage. It uses a free online backand API which is http://pokeapi.co/.  
The detailed documentation of the API is http://pokeapi.co/docsv2/.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests

To run the e2e test, you need a running globally intalled selenium webserver. For the installtion of it run the `npm install -g webdriver-managerRun` in a terminal window. If the command ran successfully, execute the `webdriver-manager update` and then `webdriver-manager start`. In another terminal window execute the `ng serve` command and than the globally installed `protractor` command will run the e2e scenarios with the following command `protractor protractor.conf.js`. For further information go to the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) page.
